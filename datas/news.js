      <p class='display-8'>22 July 2020 | in Covid, US, Health | by Leonard</p>
      <p class='display-10'> Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today updated New Yorkers on the state's progress during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.</p> 
      <p class='display-10'> "We're working hard every day to get New York's infection rate down while increasing the vaccination rate, and the state is making significant progress in that ongoing footrace," Governor Cuomo said. "But even as we gain more supply of the vaccine, grow our distribution network and get more shots in arms, New Yorkers need to stay vigilant, so that we don't lose an inch of that progress. We're expanding eligibility and continually extending our efforts to get the vaccine to underserved communities, and until every New Yorker is vaccinated I encourage everyone to keep washing their hands, wearing masks and social distancing as we get through this fight together."</p> 
      <p class='display-10'>The changes Mr. Cuomo’s aides and health officials made to the nursing-home report, which haven’t been previously disclosed, reveal that the state possessed a fuller accounting of out-of-facility nursing-home deaths as early as the summer. The Health Department resisted calls by state and federal lawmakers, media outlets and others to release the data for another eight months.</p> 
      <p class='display-10'> State officials now say more than 15,000 residents of nursing homes and other long-term-care facilities were confirmed or presumed to have died from Covid-19 since March of last year—counting both those who died in long-term-care facilities and those who died later in hospitals. That figure is about 50% higher than earlier official death tolls.</p> 
      <p class='display-10'>Garvey added that, because Schwartz is technically volunteering as vaccination czar, he is not required to take the ethics oath, under a Cuomo executive order to facilitate people pitching in amid the pandemic. The AG’s office did not respond to a request for comment from the paper.</p>

      <p class='display-10'> Gun sales in the United States reached a record level last year, with the biggest increases in background checks for firearms overlapping with months of social and political unrest, according to industry and government data.</p> 
      <p class='display-10'> Industry data and firearms background checks show nearly 23 million guns were purchased in 2020, according to Small Arms Analytics, a consulting firm based in Greenville, South Carolina.</p>
      <p class='display-10'>That's a 65% increase compared with 2019, when 13.9 million guns were sold, according to Small Arms Analytics.</p> 
      <p class='display-10'>Since there is no national gun registry, firearms industry publications and background checks are the best sources for gauging sales.</p> 
      <p class='display-10'> FBI background checks on gun buyers increased all year, but the biggest jumps -- March, June, July and December -- overlapped with periods of political and social unrest. Background checks don't correlate directly to the number of guns sold.</p> 
      <p class='display-10'>In March, the FBI conducted more than 3.7 million background checks -- a month that overlapped with the start of the pandemic lockdowns. That's more than 1 million additional background checks than were conducted in March 2019.</p>
      <p class='display-10'> During the unrest following the police killing of George Floyd, background checks surged again: to 3.9 million in June and 3.6 million in July. That compares to 2.3 million background checks in June 2019 and 2 million in July 2019.</p>
      <p class='display-10'> And the political uncertainty after the presidential election overlapped with a jump in gun background checks in November, at 3.6 million, and December at 3.9 million. That compares to 2.6 million in November 2019 and 2.9 million in December 2019.</p>
      <p class="display-5">'It just seems like we live in chaos'</p>
      <p class='display-10'> Philip Smith, founder of National African American Gun Association (NAAGA), says many of those buying guns today are people who five years ago would never have imagined they'd own a firearm. Covid-19, he says, was the game changer.</p>
      <p class="display-10"> "That was something that had people, regardless of color, regardless of your social background, your economic status, you said to yourself, 'OK if we don't have food next week, what are we going to do to protect ourselves and our families?'"</p>
      <p class="display-10"> NAAGA is seeing steady growth of about 800 to 1,000 new members a month, Smith said.

      <p class='display-8'>22 July 2020 | in Life, Time, US | by Alien</p>
      <p class='display-10'> Most of you lost an hour of your Sunday. The culprit was the beginning of daylight saving time, which is not an uncontroversial topic. Moving the clock forward every March and back every November is so jarring to some that a slew of senators have proposed keeping daylight saving time all year around.</p> 
      <p class='display-10'> The problem for these senators (and indeed anybody who hates moving forward and backward) is that Americans are quite split on what system is best for them. Most do not seem to be in favor of the senators' solution.</p>
      <p class='display-10'> An AP-NORC poll from late 2019 found that just 31% of Americans wanted to move to daylight saving time all year around. That beat out the 28% who wanted to keep switching back and forth between daylight saving and standard time, but trailed 40% who yearned for standard time all year around. </p> 
      <p class='display-10'> In other words, there's no consensus. Most Americans (71%) take a position that seems in opposition to daylight saving all the time.</p> 
      <p class='display-10'> It may be the case, however, that Americans are growing more opposed to moving the clocks forwards and backwards than they used to be.</p> 
      <p class='display-10'> Compare the AP-NORC poll to a CBS News poll taken in February 2015. In that survey, 48% liked the current system of switching back and forth. That's 20 points higher than the AP-NORC poll discovered in late 2019.</p>
      <p class='display-10'> But it's not year-round daylight saving time that has gotten more popular. Rather, it's year-round standard time. Both year-round daylight saving and standard time were each favored by 23% of Americans in 2015. This means that from the CBS News poll to the AP-NORC poll, there was a 17-point jump in year-round standard time's popularity, while just an 8-point rise in year-round daylight saving time's popularity.</p>
      <p class='display-10'> Indeed, as far as I can tell, there has never been a clear majority in favor of moving to daylight saving time all year around.</p>
      <p class='display-10'> When Gallup first asked the question in the early 40s, Americans were consistently opposed to having it all year-round. Only 36% of Americans approved of moving to daylight saving time all year around in 1941, for example. That's quite similar to where the polling is right now. The clear majority (53%) disapproved of daylight saving time all year.</p>
      <p class='display-10'> Interestingly, we have tried to move to daylight saving time all year in 1974. The Emergency Daylight Saving Time Act was signed into law to try and save energy during that year's energy crisis.</p>

      <p class='display-10'> The Biden administration launched a behind-the-scenes push last month to reach out to North Korea through multiple channels, a senior administration official has told CNN, but thus far Pyongyang has been unresponsive.</p> 
      <p class='display-10'> "To reduce the risks of escalation, we reached out to the North Korean government through several channels starting in mid-February, including in New York," the official said. "To date, we have not received any response from Pyongyang. This follows over a year without active dialogue with North Korea, despite multiple attempts by the US to engage."</p>
      <p class='display-10'> The official did not provide further details of what the outreach entailed but noted the administration has been conducting its interagency review of the United States' policy towards North Korea, "including evaluation of all available options to address the increasing threat posed by North Korea to its neighbors and the broader international community." </p> 
      <p class='display-10'> During the review process, the administration has consulted with former government officials with experience in North Korea policy, including some officials from the Trump administration, the official said. The US has also been in touch with allies from Japan and South Korea.</p> 
      <p class='display-10'> "We look forward to completing our intensive, multi-stakeholder policy review in the coming weeks," the official said.</p> 
      <p class='display-10'> Reuters first reported the outreach efforts on Saturday.</p>
      <p class='display-10'> News of the outreach comes as lawmakers and key US allies are eagerly awaiting details about Biden's North Korea policy, which they expect will be announced publicly in the coming weeks when the administration has completed a policy review, according to multiple sources familiar with the internal discussions.</p>
      <p class='display-10'> Satellite imagery obtained by CNN reveals North Korea has recently taken steps to conceal a facility that US intelligence agencies believe is being used to store nuclear weapons.</p>

      <p class='display-8'>22 July 2020 | in India, Politics, World | by Alien</p>
      <p class='display-10'> Indian climate campaigner Disha Ravi revealed she never imagined her activism would see her jailed in her first statement since her controversial arrest and detention last month.</p> 
      <p class='display-10'> Ravi, who is in her early 20s, was arrested on charges relating to her role in disseminating a toolkit that provided a list of ways supporters could help Indian farmers' months-long protest against new laws that change how the country's agricultural industry operates.</p>
      <p class='display-10'> Ravi has since been granted bail. </p> 
      <p class='display-10'> "In all the years that someone had asked me where I see myself in 5 years, I would have never answered 'jail' but here I was," she wrote, in a statement posted on Twitter. "Locked in my cell I wondered when it became a crime to think the most basic elements of sustenance on this planet were as much mine as theirs."</p> 
      <p class='display-10'> Ravi's arrest provoked outrage from high-profile figures including author Meena Harris, the niece of US Vice President Kamala Harris, and many Indian politicians, who accused authorities of trying to intimidate and muzzle a young woman for speaking her mind.</p> 
      <p class='display-10'> The toolkit, which was unsigned and publicly available on an encrypted sharing site, instructed people to call government representatives, share solidarity hashtags on social media, participate in rallies and sign petitions. It gained visibility after Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg tweeted a link to it on February 4, crediting "people on the ground in India."</p>
      <p class='display-10'> However, its release appeared to anger Indian authorities. The same day as Thunbgerg's tweet, Delhi police announced they would investigate the toolkit's creators and would look to charge them with sedition, provoking or inciting a riot and criminal conspiracy because it called for followers to "wage economic, social, cultural and regional war against India."</p>
      <p class='display-10'> Police in New Delhi argued the toolkit's main purpose to "misinformation and disaffection against the lawfully elected government." Authorities accused Ravi, whose grandparents are farmers, of helping to author the document, which was unsigned and made publicly available on an encrypted sharing site.</p>
      <p class='display-10'> As Ravi's case makes its way through India's legal system, farmers continue to protest the laws, which many believe will cost them their livelihoods.</p>
      <p class='display-10'> Historically, Indian farmers have sold their goods at auction at their state's Agricultural Produce Market Committee, where sellers were guaranteed to receive at least the government-agreed minimum price. There were restrictions on who could buy, and prices were capped for essential commodities.</p>
      <p class='display-10'> The new laws dismantled that system, instead allowing farmers to sell their goods to anyone for any price.</p>
      <p class='display-10'> Prime Minister Narendra Modi, long a proponent of free market reforms, has argued the new legislation will allow farmers sell directly to buyers or other states without a middle man.</p>
      <p class='display-10'> But many farmers say the changes will allow big companies to drive down prices. While farmers could sell crops at higher prices if the demand is there, many worry they could struggle to meet the minimum price in years when there is too much supply.</p>

    <p class='display-8'>22 July 2020 | in ISIS, Politics, World | by Alien</p>
    <p class='display-10'> Of all the battles in the fight against ISIS, the operation to retake Mosul could prove the most significant.</p> 
    <p class='display-10'> Iraqi-led forces have started what will likely be a messy and prolonged offensive to seize Iraq's second-largest city.</p>
    <p class='display-10'> Having already lost key cities -- such as Tikrit and Ramadi -- Mosul is the militant group's last bastion of power in the country. Simply put: Freeing Mosul would be the beginning of the end of ISIS in Iraq.</p> 
    <p class='display-10'> Mosul is Iraq's biggest metropolis outside of Baghdad, and gaining control of the city was one of ISIS' most significant strategic wins. When ISIS took Mosul in June 2014, it also took control of more than 2.5 million people, whom the group subjected to horrors -- public beheadings, throwing gay men to their deaths from the top of buildings and making prisoners out of men who did not grow beards and women who did not wear Islamic clothing, like burqas. There has been a mass exodus in the past two years, and today around 1 million people remain.</p> 
    <p class='display-5'> It's near critical oil fields</p>
    <p class='display-10'> Mosul's location is incredibly important. It's a key trading city not far from the borders of Syria and Turkey. Wresting Mosul away from ISIS would significantly limit the movement of fighters, weapons and supplies.</p>
    <p class='display-10'> The city is located near some of Iraq's most vital oil fields, as well an oil pipeline that services Turkey. Securing these fields could bolster Iraq's economy. It could also hit ISIS' finances hard as the militant group has been known to sell oil illegally to fund its operations.</p>
    <p class=''display-5> The city is ISIS' 'cultural capital'</p>
    <p class='display-10'> Mosul is the place where ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi declared the ISIS caliphate -- an area ruled by an Islamic government under a caliph, regarded as a successor to the Prophet Mohammed.</p>
    <p class='display-10'> According to Fawaz Gerges, author of "ISIS: A History," Mosul is a crown jewel in the so-called caliphate and has been considered the "cultural capital" since Baghdadi's declaration there.</p>
    <p class='display-5'> Mosul is home to an epic humanitarian crisis</p>
    <p class='display-10'> ISIS' control of Mosul has added tremendously to the refugee crisis, as hundreds of thousands of people have already fled the city and are now either internally displaced or living in foreign lands.</p>
    <p class='display-10'> By securing the city, the Iraqi government would be able to begin addressing the humanitarian crisis there and ease the flow of refugees into neighboring countries and beyond.</p>
    <p class='display-5'> It's unclear what a free Mosul will look like</p>
    <p class='display-10'> But defeating ISIS in Mosul is only half the battle. If the Iraqi-led forces succeed in their offensive, Baghdad will have to hold onto the city, rebuild its infrastructure and prove it can effectively govern it. Otherwise, it's back to the drawing board.</p>
    <p class='display-10'> Going by efforts to rebuild Tikrit and Ramadi, there might be little cause for optimism, Gerges told CNN. But he pointed out that significant US investment into this particular operation boosted the chances that a reconstruction is Mosul will be successful.</p>

    <p class='display-10'> After savoring the passage of his $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief package in the Rose Garden last week, President Joe Biden begins the tough work of enacting what he called a "transformational" piece of legislation, while also trying to sell Americans on the progressive goals the bill embraced.</p> 
    <p class='display-10'> As stimulus checks are rolling into the bank accounts of Americans, the President and first lady and Vice President Kamala Harris and the second gentleman are all hitting the road this week for a "Help is Here" tour, including stops in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Colorado, Georgia and Nevada. They'll explain how they will achieve the goals Biden laid out in a speech to the nation last week, including making all adult Americans eligible for the vaccine by May 1 -- a move he hopes will set the stage for small gatherings with friends and family by July Fourth.</p> 
    <p class='display-10'> But with ambitious timelines comes risk. Those benchmarks are now the criteria against which the administration will be measured at a precarious time with a pandemic that has defied many predictions and prognosticators over the past year.</p> 
    <p class='display-10'> The President's Covid-19 response team said in a briefing Friday that they believe they will have enough vaccine supply in place for all American adults by the end of May after securing commitments for 200 million doses from Moderna, an additional 200 million doses from Pfizer and another 100 million doses from Johnson & Johnson.</p>
    <p class='display-10'> But Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease specialist said Sunday that the administration still has a great deal of work to do in expanding the number of vaccination sites and vaccinators to ensure there's the infrastructure to vaccinate all Americans who want to get their shots by the end of May. The administration has repeatedly touted that it has doubled the amount of vaccine going out to the states during Biden's first seven weeks in office -- and are now averaging about 2.2 million shots per day -- but major challenges remain.</p>
    <p class='display-10'> Fauci noted that Americans are still at risk, pointing to the fact that cases have gone down but plateaued as they did in Europe, where many young people abandoned mask wearing, triggering a new surge.</p>
    <p class='display-10'> According to Fawaz Gerges, author of "ISIS: A History," Mosul is a crown jewel in the so-called caliphate and has been considered the "cultural capital" since Baghdadi's declaration there.</p>
    <p class='display-10'> "If things go as we planned, just as the President said, by the time we get into the early summer, the Fourth of July weekend, we really will have a considerable degree of normality. But we don't want to let that escape from our grasp by being too precipitous in pulling back," Fauci told CNN's Jake Tapper on "State of the Union."</p>
    <p class='display-10'> Still, even the availability of the vaccine in the US doesn't mean Americans will get it.</p>
    <p class='display-10'> The number of Americans who are still hesitant to get the vaccine remains high, even as confidence in the vaccines has improved. And though the White House is focused on improving vaccine equity, data shows that White Americans are still getting vaccinated at much higher rates than Latinx and Black Americans, even though those communities have shouldered a much higher share of the cases. A Kaiser Family Foundation analysis earlier this month of available US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data showed that among people who had received a first vaccine dose -- in instances where data about race and ethnicity was known -- two-thirds were White, 9% were Hispanic, 7% were Black and 5% were Asian.</p>
    <p class='display-10'> The political complications for Biden in convincing reluctant Americans to get the vaccine also came into sharper focus last week with a new CNN poll showing that 28% of Americans said they do not plan to get a coronavirus vaccine, compared with 69% who said they will (or already have gotten a dose of the vaccine).</p>

    <p class='display-8'>23 July 2020 | in Safety, Politics, US | by Bob</p>
    <p class='display-10'> Retired Lt. Gen. Russel Honoré, who led a review of security at the US Capitol in the wake of the January 6 riot, said Friday that the fencing surrounding the compound "will do nothing to prevent another attack" and the threat to our democracy "lies within our borders."</p> 
    <p class='display-10'> "The four miles of fences that now ring the Capitol will do nothing to prevent another attack, or to help us understand the underlying failures that allowed the riot to happen," Honoré wrote in a Washington Post op-ed that criticized federal law enforcement's response before and during the assault on the US Capitol complex.</p> 
    <p class='display-10'> The razor wire and 7-foot fencing put in place after the pro-Trump mob attacked the Capitol have become a point of contention between the Capitol Police and lawmakers. Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle have grown increasingly frustrated and swiftly pushed back on the Capitol Police's proposal in late January to build permanent fencing.</p> 
    <p class='display-10'> Honoré said in his piece that the Capitol fencing "provides a false sense of security" and compares it to the southern border wall, which he describes as an "expensive failure."</p>
    <p class='display-10'> "The complete breakdown in law enforcement was preventable," he wrote. "We have been slow to accept the reality that a danger to our democracy also lies within our borders. We have been unwilling to invest in the personnel and resources to address those dangers."</p>
    <p class='display-10'> He argued that what Capitol Hill needs instead of the fencing is "more personnel, more intelligence-gathering capabilities, better coordination with other federal law enforcement agencies, stronger internal lines of authority, and clearer command focus on threats to public property and public officials."</p>
    <p class='display-10'> Honoré also suggested replacing the fencing with retractable barriers and an updated video surveillance system.</p>
    <p class='display-10'> "The Capitol security apparatus is long past due for an overhaul," he added.</p>
    <p class='display-10'> Honoré's task force on Monday had released its final report, which calls for sweeping changes to improve US Capitol Police's emergency response and for multiple security enhancements around the Capitol complex -- the first formal effort to address the security failures.</p>
    <p class='display-10'> The report also includes recommendations for increasing Capitol Police's intelligence-gathering capabilities, adding a permanent quick reaction force and implementing mobile fencing that can replace the current temporary security structure, according to a copy obtained by CNN.</p>
    <p class='display-10'> Democratic aides told CNN that many of the report's recommendations are likely to be taken up in a security supplemental funding bill from the House Appropriations Committee.</p>
